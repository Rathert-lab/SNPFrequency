# SNPFrequency
This tool extracts the SNP frequency per 1 kb of regions defined in a bed file. The tool requires a SNP .vcf file as provided by the Galaxy tool FreeBayes for calling of genetic variants and a bed file defining the regions of interest. The tool calculates the sum of SNPs per region and then devides that by the length of the region.
